# footer.md
This file is easy to write, just write what you want to be added at the end of the page!

let's start with a `<hr>` tag so that there is a line seperating the main page by a line
```html
<hr></hr>
```
Let's add some content.
```html
<hr></hr>
<p> This is at the end of my site <p>
```
Now we will add a link to the footer, so that we can go back to the top of the page.
```html
<hr></hr>
<p> This is at the end of my site <p>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
```
and that's about it, feel free to expand upon it, but reminder that this is just a guide, you can do whatever you want!
however, this is just the footer, as a general rule of thumb, it shouldn't be too long, so that it doesn't take up too much space on the page.
