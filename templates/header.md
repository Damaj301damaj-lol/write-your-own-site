# header.md
This file is easy to write, just write what you want to be added at the beginning of the page!
```html
<h1>My Site</h1>
<p>This is my site</p>
```
Literally that's it!
however, this is just the header, as a general rule of thumb, it shouldn't be too long, so that it doesn't take up too much space on the page.
Let's expand upon it, we will add a `<hr>` tag so that there is a line seperating the header by a line
```html
<h1>My Site</h1>
<p>This is my site</p>
<hr></hr>
```
And that's about it, feel free to expand upon it, but reminder that this is just a guide, you can do whatever you want!
