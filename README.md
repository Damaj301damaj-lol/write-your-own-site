## How to write a basic site in php
This guide is made to help you create a small basic site in php, it shouldn't be difficult.

This is your reminder that google is your friend, and you can find answers to your questions there.

This repo will guide you in the process with information and how-to.

This repo will be shaped as your future site's structure, but instead of the proper extension, the files will be named with the extension `.md` (markdown) aand will help you create your site with a bit of css and php.

You may self-host this repo, or use Github Pages to host it.

Feel free to get started wherever you want, but I recommend you to start with the `index.md` file.

# Note: every tag that you open must be closed `<tag>content</tag>`, and every tag that you close must be opened if you want to use the tag again.
